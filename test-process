- Write a failing STEP in features/step_definitions/checkout_steps.rb
- This tells you where to TDD, so then:
  - Write a failing unit test (or "spec") in spec/checkout_spec.rb
  - Make the test pass by adding code to lib/checkout.rb
  - Refactor
- Repeat until the STEP passes.
- Refactor whole system
- Repeat

- lib/checkout.rb for production code
- spec/checkout_spec.rb for unit tests
